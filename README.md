<br/>
<p>Base build project for a java modular project using apache ant.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Java modularity is relatively recent, while apache ant has been with us for
 a long time. Due to the fact that today ant is still widely used, and due to 
 the lack of information, or lack of clarity of the existing information, on 
 how to write a build project for modular projects without external tools or 
 IDEs, I have decided to create this repository that centers its focus on a 
 build project created for 4 modules as an example.</p>

<ul>
	<li>FirstModule: Example module</li>
	<li>FirstModule-test: Example of a test-module for the first module (First Module)</li>
	<li>SecondModule: Example module</li>
	<li>SecondModule-test: Example of a test-module for the second module (Second Module)</li>
</ul>
